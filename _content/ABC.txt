Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse
I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth
whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me
that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street
I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me
belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf
which a few hours previous were out of sight of land
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon
stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries
of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters
loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert
if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor
most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus
when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse
and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself
though I confess there is considerable glory in that
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land
and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it
I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right
that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view
because they make a point of paying me for my trouble
whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of
And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us
considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills
and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things
at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor
I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage
and influences me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else
formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers
put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage
when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies
and jolly parts in farces though I cannot tell why this was exactly
I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises
besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk
with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds
I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote
and could still be social with it would they let me since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in
and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft
boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling
and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen
partly laden with imported cobblestones so goes the story to throw at the whales
and still another night following before me in New Bedford
it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile
as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag
and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night
that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house
for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard
when I struck my foot against the flinty projections
remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight
pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer
a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit
I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks
saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it
faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray
and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there
and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district
I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings
whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside
or whether thou observest it from that sashless window
chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow
and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon
give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals
that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives
this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas
he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked
that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it
it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it
that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose
that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist
and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry
you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue
unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it
till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed
fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset
And that harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in Javan seas
like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man
Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison
the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table
and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room
received for answer that his house was full not a bed unoccupied
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed
why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night
stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room
and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers
But the fare was of the most substantial kind not only meat and potatoes
addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner
I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together
I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on
which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever
as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea
and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face
yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest
I will here venture upon a little description of him
while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner
I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height
and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea
and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies
I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen
you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother
but people like to be private when they are sleeping
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment
the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him
and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards
and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench
and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank
and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room
and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one so there was no yoking them
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window
especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night
I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones
and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension
that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night
that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer
you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion
which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is
and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him
you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head
which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery
had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath
Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced
Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it
almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast
could see no other furniture belonging to the place
and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale
and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it
ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat
as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck
and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod
and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door
placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner
and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room
here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light
I remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too who
and completely independent of the squares of tattooing
it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning
and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin
while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room
he then took the New Zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag
He now took off his hat a new beaver hat when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull
I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner
and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger
I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night
I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him
and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him
these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face
as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas
A peddler of heads too perhaps the heads of his own brothers
for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention
and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back
at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner
and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony
I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol
The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image
feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket
then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee
during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner
and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness
and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations
to break the spell in which I had so long been bound
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say
and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me
But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning
while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire
at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian
and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure
no two parts of which were of one precise shade owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade
his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times this same arm of his
looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke
and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me
I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me
I had been cutting up some caper or other I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney
as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous
so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor
undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection
beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour
anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time
But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers
feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze
and slowly waking from it half steeped in dreams I opened my eyes
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame
yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch
I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me
and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery
and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar
and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament
For though I tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp yet
and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style
shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water
and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there
though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him
and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature
his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow
and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that
he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards
because he treated me with so much civility and consideration
for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding
He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat
and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up his boots
but his next movement was to crush himself boots in hand
is any man required to be private when putting on his boots
was a creature in the transition stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners
he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on
he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes
wrinkled cowhide ones probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning
the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room
and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made
staving about with little else but his hat and boots on
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face
contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest
dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face
and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made
and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow
but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way
And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore
he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did
or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach
may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table
and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling
many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas entire strangers to them and duelled them dead without winking
here they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling
all of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains
Queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him
that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room
and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town
that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford
any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts
Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came
In some things you would think them but a few hours old
will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation
you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers
that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador
parts of her back country are enough to frighten one
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion
all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic
they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding
and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles
whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens
where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk
their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore
as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other
as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable
and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets
THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES
and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me
there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance
was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery
and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief
that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those
in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh
ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these
and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here
though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands
how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world
if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth
yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago
how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss
wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city
and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope
doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me
there is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance
we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being
and come a stove boat and stove body when they will
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered
a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain
but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry
Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age
that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth
could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest
because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him
imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led
When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella
and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed
and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel
like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea
it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship
these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity
that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit
the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers
and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work
From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds
and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense
and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea
like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn
but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas
  He bowed his ear to my complaints  No more the whale did me   confine
    as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God
 the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible
containing only four chapters four yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures
we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters
the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God never mind now what that command was
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do remember that and hence
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz
as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days
and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that
prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas
no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux
he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo
and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin
all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods
but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent
offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide
while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah
and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent
as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history
but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless
but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold
Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour
heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received
still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room
as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place
and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him
“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed
as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish
praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed
and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her
and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale
which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him
Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as I have taken it
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks
and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft
till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead
aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward
but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep
“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul
to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them
then how furiously they mob him with their questions
but likewise another answer to a question not put by them
but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him
whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled
since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts
when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea
with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah
“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him
Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance
is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale
I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher
his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work
and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow
made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them
as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners
and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh
and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa
and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea
the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun
and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it
and inward delight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him
when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him
and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges
whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages
he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time
and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his
and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity
at every fiftieth page as I fancied stopping a moment
and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together
that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited
and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable
I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart
there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils
which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor
his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief
but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one
It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance
but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous
and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all
appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home
that is which was the only way he could get there thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter
though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that
we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher
the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world
his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits
yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him
And those same things that would have repelled most others
since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy
he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows
and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing
and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it
and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him
this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature
but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply
and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions
born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church
unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship
at peace with our own consciences and all the world
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat
but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends
there open the very bottom of their souls to each other
and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning
and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine
what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed
so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome
and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up
for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast
If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable
the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled
in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire
which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time
in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed
as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light
and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk
that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before
yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them
For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me
because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend
till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words
when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology
now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give
lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two
and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors
by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth
which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island
covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water
with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard
But this fine young savage this sea Prince of Wales
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities
if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen
For at bottom so he told me he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians
the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were
since he might now consider his father dead and gone
had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him
and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket
as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from
not at Queequeg so much for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets
but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms
and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore
and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons
yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon
he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen
in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house
Not to seem ignorant about the thing though in truth he was entirely so
concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow Queequeg puts his chest upon it
and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf
at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl
and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko
and between the High Priest and his majesty the King
for those people have their grace as well as we though Queequeg told me that unlike us
glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts Grace
the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island
dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates
and thinking himself being Captain of a ship as having plain precedence over a mere island King
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves
while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers
with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch
the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows
and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records
ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan
the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes
that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers
who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable
as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro
must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back
the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff
twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain
that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye
and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side
completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly
and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters
and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale
and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat
darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog
and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam
He only asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off
Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper
Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there
that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask
that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome
that people there plant toadstools before their houses
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois
In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast
With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters
after a perilous passage they discovered the island
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it
and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood
clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power
overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders
without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself
to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows
while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales
It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor
whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard
and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard
these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first
Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be left on the larboard hand
whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard
and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way
we at last came to something which there was no mistaking
Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time
but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns
A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown
and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt
Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed
and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt
Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen
a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us
Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him
when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs
In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again
Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra
ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night
that he had been diligently consulting Yojo the name of his black little god and Yojo had told him two or three times over
Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me
for all the world as though it had turned out by chance
but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs
But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg
and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor
that should quickly settle that trifling little affair
leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan
I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles leaving Queequeg
and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings
After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries
was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians
and then decided that this was the very ship for us
you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod
where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne
pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor
tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies
open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw
Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood
curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest
when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw
in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage
but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship
so that the insider commanded a complete view forward
I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority
was now enjoying respite from the burden of command
and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed
which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales
if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again
I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage
I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it
perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation
but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request
and the Pequod was as good a ship as any I thought the best and all this I now repeated to Peleg
Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure
who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels
the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest
the island having been originally settled by that sect
and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker
only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous
named with Scripture names a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom
strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities
And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force
and beneath constellations never seen here at the north
been led to think untraditionally and independently
he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature
For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness
it only results again from another phase of the Quaker
But unlike Captain Peleg who cared not a rush for what are called serious things
round the Horn all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot
was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad
yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific
the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence
had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty
had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character
was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin
he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume
As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate
and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible
I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling
might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune and so it was
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes
and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me
while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud
that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this
I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad
how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod
therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands
considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings
and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman
but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship widows and orphans
many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man
we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans
I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one
and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship
and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded
I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad
was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg
and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing
He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways
though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated
glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself
and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape
when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me
ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command
and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief
he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port
but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea
it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands
with a significance in his eye that almost startled me
but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about
that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale
what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab
filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him
though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him
my thoughts were at length carried in other directions
or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth
who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets
bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name
we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things
and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals
and Heaven have mercy on us all Presbyterians and Pagans alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head
when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over
but the door opening into an odd corner of the room
which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him
you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping
having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors
she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door
and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark
but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life
as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours
I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair
and all he could do for all my polite arts and blandishments he would not move a peg
do they fast on their hams that way in his native island
feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination
it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room
and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on
and the mere thought of Queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position
sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window
so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person
makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in
then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him
beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions
and coming down to the various religions of the present time
during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents
that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage
to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters
and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans
I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia
It was after a great feast given by his father the king
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island
to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor
just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys
I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg
he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject
he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion
as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety
taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts
so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan
As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship
Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam
saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft
that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches
he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief
that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church
the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I
the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world
only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing
who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies
an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg
heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases
no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish
when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan
that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question
He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers
and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent
trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him
with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object
again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn
for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head
that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind
anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did
but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine
I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not
Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores
for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing
But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases
and there is no telling how many things to be thought of
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels
yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen
the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery
and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented
whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds
and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends
the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed
for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things
a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit
And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither
ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety
and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned
But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board
Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward
he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed
down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den
could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage
I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it
it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter
he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself
At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail
whose owner at the same time coming close behind us
Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to
hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter
jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body
Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper
owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts
were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans
and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree
had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul
when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger
The strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab
and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin
and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf
that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh
and as he was not yet completely recovered so they said therefore
especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor
But there was not much chance to think over the matter
this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port
the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor
the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship
might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor
and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody
who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley
Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod
Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up
in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot
with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation
was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity
while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody
we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight
and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic
how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture
a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy Capes
a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested
once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw
ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there
did not a little run from cabin to deck now a word below
so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs
good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent
Be careful with the butter twenty cents the pound it was
and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic
the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves
could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term
earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea
while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous
As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit
of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales
it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact
the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen
our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business
and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business
ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown
But even granting the charge in question to be true
let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery
yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage
which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world
and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues
that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother
who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb
She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart
They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions
but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket
battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared
All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages
adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to
was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown
it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru
and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts
all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth
that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant
and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations
then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there
The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel
and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers all kith and kin to noble Benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other
but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable
*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head
I account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns
if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of
a man might rather have done than to have left undone
then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling
I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts
an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise
which might tell eloquently upon his cause such an advocate
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens
a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through
that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well
concerning the essential dignity of this regal process
because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair
that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere
He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine
or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous
those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness
seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares
this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come
his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates
whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action
there were certain qualities in him which at times affected
and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest
the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition
And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul
tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature
and open him still further to those latent influences which
so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery
not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril
but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward
and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions
courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship
nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him
I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living
and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew
But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized
and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had
it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas
or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance
that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes
that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars
but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture
Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike
if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun
Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold
Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles
ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons
and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase
calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat
He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster
if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft
about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order
so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars
black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe
lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter
instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers
I say this continual smoking must have been one cause
is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it
some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him
and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways
and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse
requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil
unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales
and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it
serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance
where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men
which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers
but Antarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters
But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland
Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea
the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires
To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs
you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa
and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped
moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him
and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress
that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery
Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies
and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads
because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains
the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores
where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores
the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London
The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches
only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory
that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously
though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below
I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible
for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain
with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of
much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which I felt
it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions
still I ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship
which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings
and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage
it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor
though all the time running away from it to the southward
and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed
but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition
when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity
that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch
so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail
There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him
when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness
and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight
or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound
throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it
superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded
popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come to pass
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me
that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained
though by all their minutest gestures and expressions
but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face
in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe
nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded
nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to
the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow
as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon
a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look
the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring
almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic
The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets
’twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world
especially when the still mild hours of eve came on
memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights
the less man has to do with aught that looks like death
and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle
but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates
when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail
such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step
that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks
hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks
hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow
Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man
Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect
as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out
Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck
during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs
my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble
to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs
the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made
Flask you know how curious all dreams are through all this rage that I was in
fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane
while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it all
the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is
and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout what do you think
a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen
at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera
Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down
to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written
and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale
compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning
that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification
hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species
or in this place at least to much of any description
My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them
I have had to do with whales with these visible hands
unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact
that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish
and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient
I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish
in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish
that definition is the result of expanded meditation
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat
I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers
and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology
among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale
he being the only creature from which that valuable substance
when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality
and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish
was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale
that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses
It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb
its original name was still retained by the dealers
no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen
he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas
it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans
But they precisely agree in all their grand features
nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences
that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length
has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic
growing vertically from the hinder part of the back
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible
it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial
unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters
his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain
gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming
this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race
that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales
yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan
notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions
these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned
as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans
why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted
or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale
the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him
since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one
making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them
he has never yet shown any part of him but his back
doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings
at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas
and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance
*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain
nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale
because blackness is the rule among almost all whales
and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards
he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming
the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale
to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment as some frugal housekeepers
some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil
so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose
growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers
though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food
But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies
the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn
Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity
Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage
when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace
“on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale
I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale
as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process
Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject
that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES a word
But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner
they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish
plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil
But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts
his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible
and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature
from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio
Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable
inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales
for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators
then he can readily be incorporated into this System
there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales
and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word
But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished
with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower
For small erections may be finished by their first architects
arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers
the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain
but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder
the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme
as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends
and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat
therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands
that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast
and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior
the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea
in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship
and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it
and the community of interest prevailing among a company
though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally
never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may
extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple
And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption
owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed
yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve
which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested
through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship
without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments
and leaves the highest honors that this air can give
to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert
than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency
the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain
the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization
will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing
still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess
all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me
and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth
reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg
you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial
to see whether it will be all right with that important rope
tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions
he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck
that while in the open air of the deck some officers will
bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding
surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation
the mate received his meat as though receiving alms
where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors
this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree
never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world
the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear
for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private
that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer
from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry
or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward
And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast
the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers
seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws
the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it
they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego
that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast
then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back
and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher
began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him
the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab
and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages
after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded
he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining
and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego
as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad
this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air
and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds
barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so much so
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself
Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets
all their martial bones jingling in them at every step
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters
Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains
and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is
the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom
as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri
does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more
we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians
that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes
those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex
who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit
who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts
are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go
however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze
that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future
and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned
ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand
even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes
extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements
are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks
And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life
should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness
or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling
or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you
for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle
You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body
so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget
for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water
but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing
it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe
that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here
that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations
seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been
as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise
those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect
or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep
seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it
forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over
except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship
It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe
even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark
you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned
that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement
with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect
and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces
for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up
and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck
unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men
that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat
observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving
while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other
as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions
was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket
and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself
producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him
with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke look ye
as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast
and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest
and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection
had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise
but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder
Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now
if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it
some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity
The Pagan leopards the unrecking and unworshipping things
nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage
nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts
while his three mates stood at his side with their lances
he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew
as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader
ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison
handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman
that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me
he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life
I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen
the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons
he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter
ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league
and to cries and maledictions against the white whale
the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss
the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay
but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt
might readily have prophesied it for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it
  A viewing of  those gallant whales That blew at every strand
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore
thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind devilish dark at that
thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge
secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference
many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes
so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch
that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick
Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity
that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick
were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred
the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded
in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them
such calamities did ensue in these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles
or devouring amputations but fatal to the last degree of fatality
all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick
those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters
to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate
and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events
wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to
so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life
in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors
they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea
face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels
the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth
that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces
the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints
which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike
few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale
as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan
though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale
would perhaps either from professional inexperience
especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag
who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale
but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North
these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it
we find some book naturalists Olassen and Povelson declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea
but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood
the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale
So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him
when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare
such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued
yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man
would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity
there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted
who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick
without the specific details of any certain calamity
were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered
as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined
was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous
that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time
was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability
For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged
so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain
and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them
he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points
and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby
that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific
in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas
that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days
these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen
it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions
that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks
or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood
for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away
there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power
it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales
he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale
when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea
that so much invested the whale with natural terror
his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else
he had several times been known to turn round suddenly
was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent
distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled
Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him
but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them
till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment
he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration
Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock
that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another
yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest
and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air
and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing
it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form
not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished
and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark
did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand however grand and wonderful
upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages
he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble
But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility
no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause
to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage
the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit
that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge
for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales
would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes
if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then
the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint
the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge
the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his
how all this came to be what the White Whale was to them
he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life
how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting
I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place
could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill
Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest
that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me
and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue
giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe
whiteness has been even made significant of gladness
for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day
and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings
though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor
whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge
though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power
the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar
the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology
faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity
all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture
and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith
white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord
and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool
there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue
which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood
it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter
which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute
that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love
by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds
the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast
the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature
strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish
whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread
methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God
I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns
I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet
that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell
that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses
but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies
and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses
whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies
At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen
which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god
Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains
or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon
the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness
always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse
at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror
But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye
does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies
fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible
the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall
has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart
hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue
that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer
as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world
we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms
symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness
no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul
by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls
some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men
yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time
who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day
does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long
unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States
why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name
does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy
while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves
and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe
admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay
spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions
this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible
nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon
especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples
and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties
let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him
the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost
in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings
it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks
in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes
and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes
Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West
who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow
no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness
by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air
instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery
views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses
far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day
but only smells its wild animal muskiness why will he start
so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils
the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world
goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies
the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains
the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love
But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness
and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul
it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things
the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe
and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation
that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour
is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness
that all other earthly hues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods
so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot
and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues
who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes
so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol
they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet
and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel
and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew
you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom
and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts
you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye
and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank
wherein were set down the seasons and places in which
the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head
and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow
till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts
some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead
with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul
to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet
ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes
concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey
could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world
were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated
   it   appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion
   and   portions of it are presented in the circular
   perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve   columns for the twelve months
   and horizontally through each of which   districts are three lines
   one to show the number of days that have   been spent in each month in every district
   and the two others to   show the number of days in which whales
 and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable
 that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path
 migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for
but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could
as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme
Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds
yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year
will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season
though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true
applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen
on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean
that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season
loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac
that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place
there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance
But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt
he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned
nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards
and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there
should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf
should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter
as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries tallied him
till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him
and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength
when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night
and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain
these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base
and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them
and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room
instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness
was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again
being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind
which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent
it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing
But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul
yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose
while the common vitality to which it was conjoined
the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes
and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus
So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book
as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales
is as important a one as will be found in this volume
but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon
and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds
as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair
I care not to perform this part of my task methodically
but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items
I take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself
I have personally known three instances where a whale
In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons
and I think it may have been something more than that
where he travelled for a period of nearly two years
with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions
the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels
saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them
but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach
that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable
Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales
for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be
they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him
and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil
that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini
insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man
they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street
they might receive a summary thump for their presumption
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity Nay
not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death
here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar
after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels
who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view
Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here
as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale
For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world
Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery
that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery
however transient and immediately forgotten that record
because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea
People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power
they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness
But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own
The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful
Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship
but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers
At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket
who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy
“Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations
and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock
He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered
Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship
when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore
the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest
with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation
happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains
the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present
the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale
that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair
“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail
but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing
it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up
but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship
so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him
raised the ship three feet at least out of the water
while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck
instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity
this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff
and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home
that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example
when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America
which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think
that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock
and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks
and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake
did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land
the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath
of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale
not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships
and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks
The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head
that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have
nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character
that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth
and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes
But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration
that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day
so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon Verily there is nothing new under the sun
in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general
he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian
not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned
during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople
after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years
A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it
But further investigations have recently proved to me
that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean
a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale
as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles
that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor
Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick
though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion
altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage
there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him
to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales
and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted
though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion
that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck
yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership
the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen
circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him
but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that
the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it
his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest
yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather
and they inhale its fickleness and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit
it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash
In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations
The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew
while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick
For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre
Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object that final and romantic object
and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally
he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation
and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground
Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself
That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand
closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to
and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here
Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural
but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene
and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air
that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self
As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp
ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads
I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea
only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword
and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single
and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own
with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads
and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric
which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof
and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working together
not to be swerved from its ultimate course its every alternating vibration
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads
though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange
and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing
and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air
you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward
we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows
For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when
and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed
and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail
while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale
who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air
were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats
on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban
the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head
and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil
that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew
the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command
never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough
because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general
and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation
and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun
that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself
as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them
and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck
this had in some small measure prepared them for the event
they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings
I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn
as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah
a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone
which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer
and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale
clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon
Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue
thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement
though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow
and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale
Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft
its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead
and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform
with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way
and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat
with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders
Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious
the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form
ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience
So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth
but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings
was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe
but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand
whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars
suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat
seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills
in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men
while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow
almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers
for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words
that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder
usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears
the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows
the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill
with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails
marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle
who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible
Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist
“there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes
two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead
yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat
an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist
the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us
so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean
and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie
as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat
after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern
holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness
the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat
as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm
we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view
bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length
and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern
and were at last taken up and safely landed on board
the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time
if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke
as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints
and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker
comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation
so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial
and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod
and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water
he gave me to understand that such things did often happen
I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery
that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep
were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life
considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings
was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery
I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments
but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion
all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection
a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be
like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault
“if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat
considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage
it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase
whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase
for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person
yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men
he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod
nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head
Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter
all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service
and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers
which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow
and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat
as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb
and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board
had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick
for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person
and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks
that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain
and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle
certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew
But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah
domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams
but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities
especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent those insulated
when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection
and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end
the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night
when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver
on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow
seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea
not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them
the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours
after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound
his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery
every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging
that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering
lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails
as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal
you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck
and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van
were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried
a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition
and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas
derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather
strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us
and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred
for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us
we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea
where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish
seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store
still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky
though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck
nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale
with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole
Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward
while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together
the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows
each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail
day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock
when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood
still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of
I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea
this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus
this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust
so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between
it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger
and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight
but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced
who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway
and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances
and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon
they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this
have boarded her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it had been that
he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put
except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State
if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds
how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea
that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course
and not a few of the men are personally known to each other
have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third
and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors
but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference
and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them
he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself
the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist
we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea
the whalers have most reason to be sociable and they are so
will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition
they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings
I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it
he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude
that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman
in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on
this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail
he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable
if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs
and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number
that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion
is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships
this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs
for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back
and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs
violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him
because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth
for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands
where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two
is much like some noted four corners of a great highway
where you meet more travellers than in any other part
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick
which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous
inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men
forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated
never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship
communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy
but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep
that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest
so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship
the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin
I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima
and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put
“Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you
it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common
having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes
and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous
they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather
the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals
stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands
he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way
well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes
had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney
had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean
with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes
they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East
they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories
whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams
for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests
where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies
those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey
and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors
they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland
they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave
they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew
though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach
though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific
yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman
this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile
“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven
but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic
some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it
should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect
the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it
on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward
or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters
there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company
and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless
unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine
Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship
some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her
So when they were working that evening at the pumps
there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them
as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water
gentlemen that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck
it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours watery or otherwise
straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness
at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman
“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest
that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state
the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks
and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large
it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time
some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys
Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs
consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men
the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt
the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command
that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt
by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling
only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in
he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business
in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command
“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps
for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate
but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him
without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat
till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face
steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer
by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass
bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor
now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth
meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions
stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance
clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back
the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods
the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head
“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads
and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are
through the entire breadth of the state of New York
through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages
through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties
flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life
as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice
that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats
his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities
I have received good turns from one of these Canallers
but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence
that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter
that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line
and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas
when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers
and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt
calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel
he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all
hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true
but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty
I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw
we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down
and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway
and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more
especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway
at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge
the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps
whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship
and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it
when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it
united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution
but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them
that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates
and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him
and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair
it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers
to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison
That was the last night he should spend in that den
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two
they each insisted upon being the first man on deck
and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last
verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences
he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle
the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies
who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder
and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny
he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought
which he accordingly administered in the vernacular
he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors
“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws
‘What I say is this and mind it well if you flog me
“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order
he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe
they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage
and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment
as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground
and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat
and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale
“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct
and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom
Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge
and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship
in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed
he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below
It was given him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again
as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow
the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse
Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done
“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day
so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment
the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster
were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish
shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea
a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events
as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted
and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt
through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together
till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge
wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick
all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms
the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated
they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel
and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril
which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals
and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to
assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock
and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed
and so for ever got the start of their former captain
had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians
the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead
still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him
‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy
and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas
previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo
For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples
ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda
were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being
that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth
depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda
for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface
and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling
there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald
as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers
because it was so intended when the device was first introduced
dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale
let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober
the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender
that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys
you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are
their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all
and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship
would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars
the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait
and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air
so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations
that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch
accurate hints may be derived touching his true form
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan
that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape
which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors
the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it
as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin
the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering
you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last
one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another
but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour
you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him
it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan
I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to
excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes
though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men
but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression
that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters
presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found
they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might
just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean
and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks
half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale
The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true
the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it
the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright
while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale
the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale
you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below
which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back
the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship
But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject
or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman
and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas
where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights
and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes
and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans
they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt
the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things
is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid
after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale
and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises
treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks
but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace
there are two other French engravings worthy of note
though not precisely adapted to our present purpose
when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose
three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole
the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies
seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen
representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping
and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings
as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material
specially intended for the skrimshandering business
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him
owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals
one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours
in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving
is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon
are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays
where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain
you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass
which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges
in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights
here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges
can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens
as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me
and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish
would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies
so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat
secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod
adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths
was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip
who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads
because of there being shallows and soundings there
caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers
especially when they paused and were stationary for a while
their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else
the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such
who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea
their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct
with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse
you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea
and though taking a broad general view of the thing
the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling
though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita
so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one
the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters
that however baby man may brag of his science and skill
by the continual repetition of these very impressions
man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it
that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow
that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year
when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever
but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it
worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests
sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs
so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks
and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider
and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes
as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks
so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti
but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life
so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze
when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea
when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on
and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman
cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo
Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab
so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued
no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass
than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick
we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind
as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach
no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again
Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object
that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness
that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean
yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form
they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food
For though other species of whales find their food above water
the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface
and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what
he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid
some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean
is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature
in certain external respects it would seem to belong
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described
as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp
and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds
so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub
the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business
carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub
so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one
the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs
nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth
which will bear up a considerable distributed weight
and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts
In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat
in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon
though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort
for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat
and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single
for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea
the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub
is again carried forward the entire length of the boat
to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat
where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill
From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows
it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft
twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions
with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs
bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted
and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings
he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly
the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters some few of which are casually chronicled of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line
for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils
as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm
the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm
as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder
as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair
you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror
than though seated before your evening fire with a poker
If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground
and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters
and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds
to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air
though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will
long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn
So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars
and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes
a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate
and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet
the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon
the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness
and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel
as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air
he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale
that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats
the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set
the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air
and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed
that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use
and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed
such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head
easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils
and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves
as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild
the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists
Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead
a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe
or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times
and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places stem for stern a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat
and from its now being more tight than a harpstring
you would have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water
the other the air as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once
cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea
and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way
till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood
which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea
jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale
and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman
Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish
as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed
and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out
But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish
had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day
ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea
stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made
the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet
the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost
he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest
while all the other muscles are strained and half started what that is none know but those who have tried it
I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time
no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated
no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels
the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft
to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last
except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase
but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery
it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them
the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness
The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention
which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow
for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon
Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler
who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall
It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous
convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron
as the second iron is already connected with the line
else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties
you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard
and making a prodigious sensation in all directions
is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse
how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong
as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise
eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him
each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery
as they will not fail to elucidate several most important
we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod
good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved
but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along
till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks
he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night
as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain
and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship
that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside
so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat
strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass
is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail
at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes
Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck
quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs
he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate
yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull
and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous
they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls
remains a part of the universal problem of all things
may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw
like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved
ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them
are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat
a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties
and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic
to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere
and though one or two other like instances might be set down
yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers
Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him
no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips
not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour
which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans
rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth
with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs
and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks
accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder
but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies
so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid
but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks
again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position
“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years
so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment
and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now
as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time
that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible
That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp
this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it
that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France
a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them
the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish
who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish
white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth
many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish
and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures
entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer
my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef
customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in
and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight
the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well
because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase
little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning
their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished
only seems to tickle them into still greater activity
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese
for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side
so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea
But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts
and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe
till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth
It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures
A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones
after what might be called the individual life had departed
Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin
when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named
and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble
You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods
among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale
and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus
now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass
while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows
with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale
and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange
so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it
For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water
and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings
else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard
One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long
and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass
the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber
and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale
and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath
the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously
I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat
That blubber is something of the consistence of firm
and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness
yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption
you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin
somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass
I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence
it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles
is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature
some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass
a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that
the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents
something like those in the finest Italian line engravings
But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned
if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics
then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular
I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi
This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents
effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance
which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs I should say
that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane
It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body
that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers
other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters
as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire
How wonderful is it then except after explanation that this great monster
to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man
perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice
that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer
that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre
the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks
and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls
whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale
The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship
what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen
In life but few of them would have helped the whale
but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce
a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare
nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun
because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held
in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world
and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them
It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan
the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat
upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck
some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject
that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull
the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped
if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of
so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element
And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it
Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck
was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea
and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin
and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head
and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm
where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned
where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down
for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw
and his murderers still sailed on unharmed while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched
So the signal was set to see what response would be made
the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal
all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached
the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean
even at considerable distances and with no small facility
which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board
and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between
yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land
he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod
But this did by no means prevent all communications
Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship
at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave
but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again
a conversation was sustained between the two parties
but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort
even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities
the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists
According to this account and what was subsequently learned
it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam
He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers
united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew
especially as he refused to work except when he pleased
the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him
the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition
So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew
that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship
Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated
so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship
that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates
nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure
as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others
which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling
and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant
Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick
her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick
Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale
pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated
and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity
Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat
and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity
and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale
and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance
temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen
fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards
nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated
This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence
and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed
that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale
whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed
depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans
and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more
in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars
and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod
the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale
many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair
there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew
for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere
It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene
circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded
Queequeg figured in the Highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes
attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us
nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed
So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then
I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two
I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence
And yet still further pondering while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship
which would threaten to jam him still further pondering
I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes
has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals
if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills
you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life
but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together
This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb
I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall
But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to
Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night
the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive
who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale
the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man
it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie
with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still another protection
wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach
those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail
straining and gasping there with that great iron hook poor Queequeg
as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters it
and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril
he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying
had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg
“it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board
except when I hit a whale or something of that sort
But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales
a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near
And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures
and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all
and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat
yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded
the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day
and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast
An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight
in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale
and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship
For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical
for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction
the contending strain threatened to take them under
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain
a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel
that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water
went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him
and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went
as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock
While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing
not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan
but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so
switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship
do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now
“Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you
and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much
that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see
I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion
where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him
the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale
but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck
and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand
the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy
they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale
As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads
you are struck by the general contrast between these heads
you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him
this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit
Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely
so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head
it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you
any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind
while in most other animals that I can now think of
the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power
so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain
effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head
which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys
must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts
while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him
and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes
A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan
he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him
that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance
to examine any two things however large or however small at one and the same instant of time
never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other
in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it
the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness
that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects
as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid
that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats
I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition
in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye
and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill
this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right
While the ear of the former has an external opening
that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane
that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye
and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals
and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it
with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach
In most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth
and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles
and when the proper time comes some few days after the other work Queequeg
as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects
you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak
when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet
in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea
whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner
he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem
Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast
I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam
which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone
form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres
when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time
Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable
we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable
there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds
a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language
*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker
consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw
Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance
furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances
do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection
the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment
Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about
would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ
you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone
only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away
who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years
I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated
for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself
or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling
perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history
You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water
you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards
you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head
as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose
and that what nose he has his spout hole is on the top of his head
you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head
nearly one third of his entire length from the front
without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever
and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad
you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale
the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm
loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks
By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at
that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them
the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface
and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water
considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope
so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction
to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes
there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life
only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is by the cord
So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster
when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats
I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity
that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien
you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth
But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter
you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon
and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones
its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale
At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin
which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side
of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent
may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front
as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys
so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature
as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water
or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head
and since as has been elsewhere set forth the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature
then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale
untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents
and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles
to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip
till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck
till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head
There still high elevated above the rest of the company
to whom he vivaciously cries he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower
he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian
to whom another person has reached up a very long pole
it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more
Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder
the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm
or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy
or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so
who amid the general consternation first came to his senses
the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head
almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom
they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea
whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk
was clearing the whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles a sharp cracking noise was heard
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out
and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung
till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg
seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way
an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head
was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks
a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue
and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen
Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand
and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian
Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom
but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be
through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg
of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments
Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing
and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself
the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents
leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well a double welded
But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it
so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed
affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run
smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti
and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale
this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken
Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar
or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon
Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men
and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein
Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features
and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression
must very largely affect the countenance of the whale
is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene
that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous
your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled
which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne
perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale
a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning
the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it
the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees
very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line
you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink
as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer
you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature
though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so
his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World
and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics
to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square
and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base
But in life as we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane is angularly filled up
and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm
At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass
The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life
like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec
it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end
you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull
and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power
though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is
all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper
I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive
I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul
as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale
and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across
but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance the spinal cord as the brain
the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists
I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment
I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world
but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude
you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific
the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects
impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern
and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle
the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale
with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness his last drop of Bremen oil being gone
he and the other three German boats that soon followed him
they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind
rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness
as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea
as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him
for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social
though indeed their back water must have retarded him
like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet
which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses
expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish
and the other whales were going with such great velocity
he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him
he seemed quite confident that this would be the case
and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss
chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey
occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of
had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman
and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet
while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright
or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin
So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air
and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable
there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied
Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke
that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out
the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines
they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on
whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way
this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back
this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes
it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best
that the longer the stricken whale stays under water
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea
not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock
For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail
Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea
the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface
relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows
when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea
were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats
the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions
so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon
a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system
and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface
his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams
that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period
they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound
because no vital part of him had thus far been struck
and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance
At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound
bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore
that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain
while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship
the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled
the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales
and no prominence of any kind to denote their place
there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling
that when at length the ship would have been capsized
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places
and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached
while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk
this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing
nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy
with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface
their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic
then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking
consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him
prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life
that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale
his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton
from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free
they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again
announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats
that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it
And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute
There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method
I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong
that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda
and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off
rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day
inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart
there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda indeed
by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of St
for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together
it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St
George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land
instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep
have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale
Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us
and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback
when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists
it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene
we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St
since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St
that antique Crockett and Kit Carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish
this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale
and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order
we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster
one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos
resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions
whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation
and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans
standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times
equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale
and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts
but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop
Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth
it has been divined by other continental commentators
that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship
he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by
But he had still another reason for his want of faith
Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea
He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean
and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea
such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days
seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea
the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah
in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil
some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm
and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely
and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment
Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it
But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale
its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking
the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length
the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon
by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting
that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance
on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance
deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies
he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat
glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight
Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand
thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm
in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash
That for six thousand years and no one knows how many millions of ages before the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea
and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale
watching these sprinklings and spoutings that all this should be
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills
the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs
the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere
Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth
that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality
inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element
which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle
though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words
and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath
he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time
or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air
just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable
and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true
the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings
he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again
he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air
will he finally go down to stay out his full term below
that in different individuals these rates are different
why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out
For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught
when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight
breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving for two or three pulsations
so that whatever other business he has to attend to
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time
if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water
then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him
it could not be expected to have the power of smelling
But owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water or whether it be vapor no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head
as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal
unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living
chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air
whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath
or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal
but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle
Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be
there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration
in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things
I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it
and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it
when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout
And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout
how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor
the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head
as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout
You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer
who coming into still closer contact with the spout
by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale
inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings
a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head
after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic
this seems an additional argument for the above supposition
to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea
and that vapor as you will sometimes see it glorified by a rainbow
as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts
through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind
this combination makes neither believer nor infidel
but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye
Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad
gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness
In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes
the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews
the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique
and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry
But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments
which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes
so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point
at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions
where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power
those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it
Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules
As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe
he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son
in which his idea has been most successfully embodied
form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings
Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of
its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace
leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming
that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw
but if it comes sideways through the opposing water
These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery
that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping
when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea
and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels
a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail
Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas
you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air
You would almost think a great gun had been discharged
and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity
As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back
they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface
his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air
Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven
have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell
and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes
such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant
the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence
so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned
should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality
much less the creatures to which they respectively belong
For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan
which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air
*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous
inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant
there are not wanting some points of curious similitude
It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk
by these methods intelligently conversed with the world
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body
and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra
and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes
conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca
Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java
and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands
they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire
with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched
The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean
have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java
they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute
lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra
have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits
fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears
Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers
the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed
we occasionally hear of English and American vessels
Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea
over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale
the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world
previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific
and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it
while other ships may have gone to China from New York
her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves
So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come
as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java
was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising
But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow
and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air
Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts
when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft
and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us
that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans
instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies
that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection
To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans
may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds
you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together
and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands
and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze
showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis
As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains
all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear
and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain
even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits
gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle
and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats
the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number
Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming
loudly directing attention to something in our wake
rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales
till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits
how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit
in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased
And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing
and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance
how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end
like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it
without being able to drag the firm thing from its place
But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew
after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern
the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side
the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship
than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays
by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale
become notified of the three keels that were after them
so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets
when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution
The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming
In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number
Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep
they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures
withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us
for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated
each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal
the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances
and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated
yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal
you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb
as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him
by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us
and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits
knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed
now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance
pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts
though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together
a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used
more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time
so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure
fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg
They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball
in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block
On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks
that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion
we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal
as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales
produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods
we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales
more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd
no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us
We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in
the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up
we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves
inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles
and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles
must have contained at least two or three square miles
At any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon
as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold
and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping
these smaller whales now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence
or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at
till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface
another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side
floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales
and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers
was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent
and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast
that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old
though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule
that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope
and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air
Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan
by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond
after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months
but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that
though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights
did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments
do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm
and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me
deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy
the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host
or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle
where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert
to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again
he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold
yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd
was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery
and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright
the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little
then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell
in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters
the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre
The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks
leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening
and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet
we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles
while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was
it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement
for having clumped together at last in one dense body
they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness
but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern
and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed
are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales
and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations
evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies
surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem
The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking
while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings
they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety
You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season
and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile
they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there
and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year
my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family
Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way
presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies
if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss
he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed
the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers
and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers
Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile
like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines
the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks
for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength
those sons and daughters must take care of themselves
For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named
then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens
goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers
and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors
as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school
so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster
he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there
would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself
but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale
and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils
The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years
a lone whale as a solitary Leviathan is called proves an ancient one
and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters
The schools composing none but young and vigorous males
For while those female whales are characteristically timid
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout
that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard
Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes
and her companions swim around her with every token of concern
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery
of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company
and be finally killed and captured by another vessel
and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies
after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm
Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen
Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law
yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it
which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it
by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif
so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside
among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases
where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party
wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas
and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs
and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done
which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale
the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position
he instituted an action to recover possession of her
that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady
and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness
along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other
because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives
and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them
and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge
the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted
and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case
be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence
for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture
that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land
and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail
on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car
specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty
I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years
had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle
all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites
which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them
up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman
fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round
meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger
or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone
and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money
the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed
an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace
begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign
We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right
which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers the whale and the sturgeon
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter
but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale
the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish
may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality
“In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan
It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea
“that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day
whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside
it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale
when the living are incompetent to bury the departed
that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it
notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality
we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside
and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first
it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia
leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil
in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles
and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there
it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm
with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again
he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste
and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there
the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour
and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck
he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side
who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much
were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales
Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl
and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door
after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day
could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times
during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus
who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him
so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain
without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity
he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview
By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin
who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them
“you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me
and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship
but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink
Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body
and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions
at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea
and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs
it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam
when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague
which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it
as one river will flow into and then along with another
and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber
whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea
for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris
but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay
And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal
owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen
Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved
that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly
that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London
try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done
and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed
that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland
of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg
which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack
this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out
without being taken home to Holland for that purpose
and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler
whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor
as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman
and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own
whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale
ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight
which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer
in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires
that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut
when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre
and therefore came off not altogether discreditably
to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap
that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run
which had taken several turns around his chest and neck
the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew
Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate
as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip
he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future
which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance
a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity
how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides
that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly
such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity
is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances
is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him
but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot
where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes
that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs
it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself
where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed
others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs
It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid
I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger
I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it
I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me
that at last I was continually squeezing their hands
let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness
I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower
not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy
which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish
It is tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still contains some oil
and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness
dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple
It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted
supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season
and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne
but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe
but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen
glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale
and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan
When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents
the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him
pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea
staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field
he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling
while employed in the peculiar functions of his office
an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse
inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated
She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar
but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides
Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand
While employed in polishing them one man in each pot
side by side many confidential communications are carried on
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation
that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact
that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid
will descend from any point in precisely the same time
The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck
by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works
this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates
for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage
except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel
still contains considerable of its unctuous properties
the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames
which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues
as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots
To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil
which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces
and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth
all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works
As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures
as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them
the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers
and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night
so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm
I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong
I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart
though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card
rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern
just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night
nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon
that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him
and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges
and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces
so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain
for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors
oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps often but old bottles and vials
even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game
if I may the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold
where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities
the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea
the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over
and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck
and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea
this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling
One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel
The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue
This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil
and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side
and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness
All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away
the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded
then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions
object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle
where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line
they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship
and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul
I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage and
but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks
and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him
with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose
and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast
as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there
he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it
as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them
And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes
though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands
and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach
nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night
so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world
while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac
and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra
and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe
to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self
small gains for those who ask the world to solve them
the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope
and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long
is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac
your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter
lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw
He too has been watching all of these interpreters myself included and look now
his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain
Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own
and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod
it is no very easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it
for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks
and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson
and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention
Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again
hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain
that every little untoward circumstance that befell him
and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap
all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship
they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous
and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks
one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale
and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest I ever saw
to toss it overboard down comes the tail like a Lima tower
the barb ript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came out nigh my wrist
The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out
he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt
and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains
to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line
late of the reverend clergy am a strict total abstinence man
that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence
once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest
and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system
and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other
only let the whale have another chance at you shortly
that accursed thing is not always what least allures
comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons
that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale
and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm
and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open
their mother only knows and under their immediate auspices
and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin
though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world
being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way
I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast
very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel it minds me of the noble
and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour
and all hands visitors and all were called to reef topsails
and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails
though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle
and roll them about in you after they were swallowed
and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it
and some other English whalers I know of not all though were such famous
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research
Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders
from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery
this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural
professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St
giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble this same Dr
this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland
contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery
Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading
I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer
during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me
capable of a transcendental and Platonic application
consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery
being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation
and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas
on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil
and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford
enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers
and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example
I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect
or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features
But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones
but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone
the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams
few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale
I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature
a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag
And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic
for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo
I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque
being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu
had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent
and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen
where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it
the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame
so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout
the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees
the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure
and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it
The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles
those same words are plainly heard without the walls
when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale
and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued
I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine
To and fro I paced before this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the ribs and with a ball of Arsacidean twine
the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib
These admeasurements I now propose to set before you
I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please
Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to
a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale
the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged
were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds
because he was lord of the seignories of those parts
in all his bony cavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon his lower jaw
and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side
Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column
threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum
and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead
The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm
there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics
and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing at least
what untattooed parts might remain I did not trouble myself with the odd inches
should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale
of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length
and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference
he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants
Having already in various ways put before you his skull
I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones
But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton
and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter
otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view
the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body
was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals
till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches
they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams
I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance
that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form
the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet
the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part
all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh
for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale
can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out
They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire
but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail
only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines
Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan
it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise
not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood
and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels
Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent
Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary
that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations
I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject
and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep
with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth
No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea
that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct
the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting
and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark
all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period
which is the last preceding the superficial formations
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time
they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects
and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp
Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen
it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale
that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body
and in his paper read before the London Geological Society
one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons
but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans
when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics
he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs
unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale
and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust
whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character
there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere
similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale
for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore
that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple
which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost
he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires
those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones
by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter
and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton
that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture
that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods
if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny
For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk
that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born
do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets
by the relative proportions in which they are drawn
I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated
one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers
and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world
and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts
whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters
Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo
overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri
where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch
in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished
to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction
Though so short a period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London
and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region
and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man
in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West
does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale
and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated
For they are only being driven from promontory to cape
and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets
some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle
hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas
and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there
some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions
yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter
that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes
And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants
and by all the successive monarchs of the East if they still survive there in great numbers
their probably attaining the age of a century and more
several distinct adult generations must be contemporary
and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men
and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe
and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood
The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London
had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person
the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench
Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood
that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground
nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured
that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe
that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove
since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy
that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings
that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world
some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave
there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing
while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them
To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries
carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods
every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light
That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness
possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him
to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining
moodily unaccounted for by Ahab invested itself with terrors
not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails
to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others
he bade him without delay set about making a new leg
the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night
independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use
the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed
Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn
and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own
besides the application to him of the generic remark above
this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship
and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business
he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes
The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold
a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices
A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole
Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation
and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there
but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation
But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him
all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence
for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things
that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world
not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness
living without premeditated reference to this world or the next
that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence
he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct
must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers
He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful
assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a common pocket knife
he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty
and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more
that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing
and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg
and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench
I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold
he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work
’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome
an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here
I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman
I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it
how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar
put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was
thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest
and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with
says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer
What was that now about one leg standing in three places
should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall
According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning
Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight
while by the changed character of the withdrawn water
the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo
from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles
between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands Niphon
or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year
What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving
“Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself
but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself
“A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube
with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin
but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed
imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection
it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound
and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above
vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood
till at last the piled decks were hard to get about
Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then
must not only face all the rage of the living whale
but as we have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea
and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement
resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage
the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime
like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well
he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever
till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing
and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness
a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die
An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage
as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died
which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
So that let us say it again no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those
whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg
and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked
said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood
he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him
and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes
for not only do they believe that the stars are isles
that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock
had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands
and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made
he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character
the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference
now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be
and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities
he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it
inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction
commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him
since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore
Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye
and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat
and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot
Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed
then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between
and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view
it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars
But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death
whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure
there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized
and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat
in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island
had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth
and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth
so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold
and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed
And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his
When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea
I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks
for now the long supplication of my youth was answered
that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue
whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath
like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St
and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands
as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging
and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea
that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming
and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated
had not removed his portable forge to the hold again
being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen
or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture
bowing over still further his chronically broken back
and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart
a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait
had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners
And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in
and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate
and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement
so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness
on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family
till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest
glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children
familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape
Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this
but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried
it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote

here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death
began hammering it upon the anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights
I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad
these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers
Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one
and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame
seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil
plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by
the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them
and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat
as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood
and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon
all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship
Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground
or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising
and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves
that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang
and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts
while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure
But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries
though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life
mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind
and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain
and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm
you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid
the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success
for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish
Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm
but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for
the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests
that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler
that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod
the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle
gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew
firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille
as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea
so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him
and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion
the other all forebodings as to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene
seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together
and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done
such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air
that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles
sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying the turning sunwards of the head
somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before
the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to
who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas
Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here
in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest
The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart
These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall
but the windward one could not be reached till morning
and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night
A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah
and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world
“And when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere I can follow
and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship
the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes
and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon
was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude
he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian
and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness
Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant
he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him
and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown
where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet
as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light
As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet
and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the mute
seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed
“I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow
‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine
the tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure
Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders
gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands
that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms
It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky
like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town
that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport
to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there
while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats
“markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward
we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home
At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness
and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead
but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire
as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil
so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast
But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth
besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging
so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside
suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux
each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air
as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft
all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence
and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come
which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft
and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall
Then turning the last link held fast in his left hand
but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional
the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height
but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off
and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale
But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck
and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held
“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine
whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe
you may pound that knot there as much as you please
but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying
that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here
than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas
Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again
a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat
even though preventer tackles had been attached to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller was indispensable
while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast
it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses
at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards
it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion
The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed
so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible
that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it
In compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately
Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily
than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance
The cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was burning fitfully
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there
though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed
but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself
it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage
the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place
and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit
and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake
for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else
but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew
that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms
essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven
Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel
the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal
the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship
even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson
and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted
and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind
for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her
while Stubb and Flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced
their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate
the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries
to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do
whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill
in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses
the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles
was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors
but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own
Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors
and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow
and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining
after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod
he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it
Then going through some small strange motions with it whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel
for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs
While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage
regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship
as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour
all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly
and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern
jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows
the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely
the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world
let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together
unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here
Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters
all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids
Yet the grey Manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals
must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her
because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals
arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress
But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning
when a cry was heard a cry and a rushing and looking up
a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken
and that parched wood also filled at its every pore
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before
but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found
and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage
all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end
when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin
they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me
not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work
each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin
I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg
hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes
a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same
and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate
made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water
the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew
It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous
which had led them some four or five miles from the ship
the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water
the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been instantly lowered in chase
this fourth boat the swiftest keeled of all seemed to have succeeded in fastening at least
whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers
and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight
she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat
But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen
though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her
and though she had thus continued doing till daylight
yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen
the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the Pequod
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search
by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart
separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase
the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity
had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race
that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them
now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case
and nestling safely at home now a child of your old age too Yes
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit
she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot
her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men
you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him
and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck
that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted
which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours
gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now
his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say We two watchmen never rest
by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck
or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits
though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch
whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for
But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck
yet these two never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary
Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain
so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange
whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought
he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them
and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end
with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin
and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch
Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last
within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height
When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging
its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it
whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck
the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea
almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too
that this was the very man he should select for his watchman
one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon
only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight
But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good
whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together
and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin
But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea
but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism
the contrast was only in shades and shadows without
the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea
a soft and tremulous motion most seen here at the equator denoted the fond
untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn
Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze
the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity
But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel
so long cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck
she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea
nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around
out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore
which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without oh
staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise
recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper
they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side
Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail
when the old man as his wont at intervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned
sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale
and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible
The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak
by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead
and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it
Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck
Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle
so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands
and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither
the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead
at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump
and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans
At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey
that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible
involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond
a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade
the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea
and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish
A gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns
No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity
but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes
through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea
still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk
entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water
for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch
and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air
towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward
for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle
and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths
he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel
and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white
shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea
and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar
Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition
commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern
by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis
shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat
slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth
scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse
while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out
as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way
which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated
and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across
at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite
vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows
and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feet out of the water the now rising swells
the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone
triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud
By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him
Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew
as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him
like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst
more than enough was it for them to look to themselves
lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways
nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape
they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone
she effectually parted the white whale from his victim
But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it
those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale
a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude
offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase
and were soon swayed up to their cranes the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her and then hoisting everything to her side
so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired
or to spread one to a still greater breadth thus to and fro pacing
and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth
but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead
except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on
that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale
is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery
and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried
pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time
as well as his probable rate of progression during that period
and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible
in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote
the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water
is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land
And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace
the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot
there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep
so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles
will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude
But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end
are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales
And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew
The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before
these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison
reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark
and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible
this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race
though it was put together of all contrasting things oak
and hemp yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull
both balanced and directed by the long central keel
and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to
some reached forth the other with impatient wavings
after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry
that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles
The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard
as much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet
not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head
but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths
the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air
shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more
and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky
and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity
to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale
the White Whale churning himself into furious speed
and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat
seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made
incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field
and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him
though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little
Caught and twisted corkscrewed in the mazes of the line
twice sundering the rope near the chocks dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea
the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines
irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes
the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round
like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch
While the two crews were yet circling in the waters
while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial
twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks
and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up
the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom
till it fell again gunwale downwards and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it
The first uprising momentum of the whale modifying its direction as he struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it
to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made
he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side
the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin
as if satisfied that his work for that time was done
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one
and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me
can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found
be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand a lipless
’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled
and everything passed nearly as on the previous night
and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight
as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow
heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial
and this morning the first of its throwing open to them
between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava
they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells
and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces
but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man
however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack
and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about
the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake
Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way
was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck
In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern
seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull
and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites
the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried
and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks a matter sometimes well known to affect them
they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others
and the third the evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may
he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel
the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence
Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles
as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice
the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains
leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale
Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven
The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead
and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks
and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again
the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him
for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore
and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage
which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him
though for the present her headway had been stopped
and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea
while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side
busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances
far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart
and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore
or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him
he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance as the whale sometimes will and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist
spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow
that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung
three of the oarsmen who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart
and were therefore unprepared for its effects these were flung out
in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line
and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats
the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug
the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship
seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions
the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves
trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water
just as they had darted from their various employments
which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head
sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed
now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief
and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim
bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom
the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea
carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight
But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast
a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air
in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood
and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab
would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf
and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago
when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat
when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me
that in her retracing search after her missing children
