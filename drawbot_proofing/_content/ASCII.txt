@ is also used on some wireless routers/modems, where a solid green @ symbol indicates the router is connected and a solid amber @ indicates there is a problem[citation needed].
A ZIP Code is a postal code used by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Introduced in 1963, the basic format consists of five digits. In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it includes the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designate a more specific location.
A common programming convention is to use a leading underscore in a name (for example _name) to indicate that the name is intended for internal use within a library (computing) or a header file and does not appear in an API.
Alt-J (stylised as alt-J, or is an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds, by Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Thom Sonny Green (drums), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass).
Ampersands are commonly seen in business names formed from partnership of two or more people, such as Johnson & Johnson, Dolce & Gabbana, Marks & Spencer, A&P (supermarkets), and Tiffany & Co., as well as some abbreviations containing the word and, such as AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph), R&D (research and development), R&B (rhythm and blues), B&B (bed and breakfast), and P&L (profit and loss).
As Yankee manager, Martin led the team to consecutive American League pennants in 1976 and 1977; the Yankees were swept in the 1976 World Series by the Cincinnati Reds but triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games in the 1977 World Series. The 1977 season saw season-long conflict between Martin and Steinbrenner, as well as between the manager and Yankee slugger Reggie Jackson, including a near brawl between the two in the dugout on national television, but culminated in Martin's only world championship as a manager. He was forced to resign midway through the 1978 season after saying of Jackson and Steinbrenner, "one's a born liar, and the other's convicted"; less than a week later, the news that he would return as manager in a future season was announced to a huge ovation from the Yankee Stadium crowd. He returned in 1979, but was fired at season's end by Steinbrenner. From 1980 to 1982, he managed the Oakland Athletics, earning a division title with an aggressive style of play known as "Billyball", but he was fired after the 1982 season. He was rehired by the Yankees, whom he managed three more times, each for a season or less and each ending in his firing by Steinbrenner. Martin died in an automobile accident in upstate New York on Christmas night, 1989, and is fondly remembered by many Yankee fans.
Assembled on the same Sindelfingen line used for the S-Class, the model is targeted against the Bentley Mulsanne and Rolls-Royce Phantom. At 5.453 metres (17.89 ft) long with a wheelbase of 3.365 metres (11.04 ft) (132.5 inches), approximately 20 centimetres (7.9 in) longer than the long-wheelbase S-Class models. The Mercedes-Maybach will be available as S500 (S550 in the US) and S600 models, with 4matic all-wheel-drive optional with the V8 engine. Acceleration is 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 km/h) in 5.0 seconds. The base car has several colour finish options and the choice between a three-seat rear bench, or two seats reclining. Options include: air-conditioned, heated and massaging seats; heated armrests; system to pump scented, ionised air around the cabin; and a 1540 watt Burmester 3D surround sound system with 24 speakers. Maybach S500 assembly in Pune, India, began in September 2015, making India the second country to produce a Maybach.
CCR5 is a 32-base-pair deletion that introduces a premature stop codon into the CCR5 receptor locus, resulting in a nonfunctional receptor. CCR5 is required for M-tropic HIV-1 virus entry. Individuals homozygous for CCR5 do not express functional CCR5 receptors on their cell surfaces and are resistant to HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk exposures.
Due to inconsistent usage, it is not always clear from the context what a percentage is relative to. When speaking of a "10% rise" or a "10% fall" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity. For example, if an item is initially priced at $200 and the price rises 10% (an increase of $20), the new price will be $220. Note that this final price is 110% of the initial price (100% + 10% = 110%).

In 1973, a spelling reform replaced kra in Greenlandic with the Latin small letter q (and its capital form, with the Latin capital letter Q)
In BASIC, Lisp-family languages, and C-family languages (including Java and C++), operator < means "less than".
In Java, C, and C++, the operator >> is the right-shift operator. In C++ it is also used to get input from a stream, similar to the C functions getchar and fgets.
In many PC-based computer games in the US and UK, the ` key (on U.S. English and U.K. keyboards) is used to open the console so the user can execute script commands via its CLI.
In microblogging (such as Twitter and StatusNet-based microblogs), @ before the user name is used to send publicly readable replies (e.g. "@otheruser: Message text here"). The blog and client software can automatically interpret these as links to the user in question. This use of the @ symbol was also made available to Facebook users on September 15, 2009. In Internet Relay Chat (IRC), it is often shown before a user's nick to mark the operator of a channel.
In online discourse, @ is used by some anarchists as a substitute for the traditional circle-A.
In the electronics industry it is common to use the character R instead of the symbol, thus, a 10 resistor may be represented as 10R. This is the British standard BS 1852 code. It is used in many instances where the value has a decimal place. For example, 5.6 is listed as 5R6. This method avoids overlooking the decimal period, which may not be rendered reliably on components or when duplicating documents.
In the same manuscript Leibniz wrote x2 = x3 /33 Leibniz also used the characteristic triangle in this manuscript, though both Pascal and Barrow had used it before him.
Infinity symbol created by John Wallis in 1655 refers to things without any limit. Usually is used in mathematics or physics to express that some things have no limit. For example, set of natural numbers has no limit and could be expressed by infinity sign. Infinity is designated as the symbol because it was imagined as a special variation of ouroborus snake - an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.
It is not correct to divide by 100 and use the percent sign at the same time. (E.g. 25% = 25/100 = 0.25, not 25% / 100, which actually is (25/100) / 100 = 0.0025.)

Martin was born in a working-class section of Berkeley, California. His skill as a baseball player gave him a route out of his home town. Signed by the Pacific Coast League Oakland Oaks, Martin learned much from Casey Stengel, the man who would manage him both in Oakland and in New York, and enjoyed a close relationship with him. Martin's spectacular catch of a wind-blown Jackie Robinson popup late in Game Seven of the 1952 World Series saved that series for the Yankees, and he was the hitting star of the 1953 World Series, earning the Most Valuable Player award in the Yankee victory. He missed most of two seasons, 1954 and 1955, after being drafted into the Army, and his abilities never fully returned; the Yankees traded him after a brawl at the Copacabana club in New York during the 1957 season. Martin bitterly resented being traded, and did not speak to Stengel for years, a time during which Martin completed his playing career, appearing with a series of also-ran baseball teams.
Mathematical notation uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the summation symbol, an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter Sigma.

On some online forums without threaded discussions, @ is used to denote a reply; for instance: "@Jane" to respond to a comment Jane made earlier. Similarly, in some cases, @ is used for "attention" in email messages originally sent to someone else. For example, if an email was sent from Catherine to Steve, but in the body of the email, Catherine wants to make Keirsten aware of something, Catherine will start the line "@Keirsten" to indicate to Keirsten that the following sentence concerns her. This also helps with mobile email users who cannot see bold or color in email.
One of the greatest treasures for the historian of mathematics is the notes that Leibniz made as he was discovering the calculus. We can follow the details of his invention in an English translation in The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz (1920), edited by J. M. Child. In the manuscript dated October 29, 1675 Leibniz wrote:
OneHalf is a DOS-based polymorphic computer virus (hybrid boot and file infector) discovered in October 1994. It is also known as Slovak Bomber, Freelove or Explosion-II. It infects the master boot record (MBR) of the hard disk, and any files with extensions .COM, .SCR and .EXE. However, it will not infect files that have SCAN, CLEAN, FINDVIRU, GUARD, NOD, VSAFE, MSAV or CHKDSK in the name.
Opossums are usually solitary and nomadic, staying in one area as long as food and water are easily available. Some families will group together in ready-made burrows or even under houses. Though they will temporarily occupy abandoned burrows, they do not dig or put much effort into building their own. As nocturnal animals, they favor dark, secure areas. These areas may be below ground or above.
Parentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).
Related to approximation of functions is the asymptotic value of a function, i.e. the value as one or more of a function's parameters becomes arbitrarily large. For example, the sum (k/2)+(k/4)+(k/8)+...(k/2^n) is asymptotically equal to k. Unfortunately no consistent notation is used throughout mathematics and some texts will use to mean approximately equal and ~ to mean asymptotically equal whereas other texts use the symbols the other way around.
Specifically, in C and other languages following C syntax conventions, such as C++, Perl, Java and C#, a | b denotes a bitwise or; whereas a double vertical bar a || b denotes a (short-circuited) logical or. Since the character was originally not available in all code pages and keyboard layouts, ANSI C can transcribe it in form of the trigraph ??!, which, outside string literals, is equivalent to the | character.
The Hydro Power Plant is the oldest hydropower plant on the river Daugava and the third largest in Latvia located in The complex consist of two power plants. The first plant was built from 1936 to 1940. The plant was totally renovated from 1998 to 2001, including replacement of four hydroelectric sets with a nominal output of around 65 MW.
The Infiniti QX80 (called the Infiniti QX56 until 2014) is a full-size luxury SUV built by Nissan Motor Company Infiniti division. The naming convention originally adhered to the current trend of using a numeric designation derived from the engine's displacement, thus QX56 since the car has a 5.6-liter engine. From the 2014 model year, the car was renamed the QX80, as part of Infiniti's model name rebranding. The new name carries no meaning beyond suggesting that the vehicle is larger than smaller models such as the QX60.
The Jinshin War devastated the Palace, and was renamed Furutsu ("old port"). A new capital, (now Kyoto), was established in the immediate neighborhood in 794, and was revived as an important traffic point and satellite town of the capital. With the establishment of the new capital, the name of the city was restored to
The `...` syntax is referred to as command substitution. It replaces a command with its output.
The chassis was significantly revised for 1990, and resulted in the new 463 G-Class. Equipped with anti-lock brakes, full-time 4WD and a trio of electric locking differentials. The interior was totally upgraded, finished with wooden accents and optional leather upholstery. The 463 features a larger choice of engines, with the V8-powered 500 GE added in 1993. The 500 GE was produced in limited numbers for just two years. Steering wheel was revised for 1993 model year. All 463 G-Wagens began using Mercedes-Benz's new letter-first naming scheme in 1994, as well as another major steering wheel revision which included driver airbags.

The double vertical bar operator "||" denotes string concatenation in PL/I, standard ANSI SQL, and theoretical computer science (particularly cryptography).
The estimated sign, also referred to as the e-mark (unicode U+212E), is a mark that can be found on some pre-packed goods in Europe. The estimated sign indicates that the packaging fulfils European Union Directive 2009/34/EC.
The infinity symbol (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity.
The last team for whom Martin played, the Minnesota Twins, gave him a job as a scout, and he spent most of the 1960s with them, becoming a coach in 1965. After a successful managerial debut with the minor-league Denver Bears, Martin was made Twins manager in 1969, and led the club to the American League West title, but was fired after the season. He then was hired by a declining Detroit Tigers franchise in 1971, and led the team to an American League East title in 1972 before being fired by the Tigers late in the 1973 season. He was quickly hired by the Texas Rangers, and turned them for a season (1974) into a winning team, but was fired amid conflict with ownership in 1975. He was almost immediately hired by the Yankees.
The mark looks like a stylised lowercase "e" and its shape, is precisely defined by an EU directive.
The notation a b means that a is greater than or equal to b (or, equivalently, not less than b, or at least b),; "not less than" can also be represented by the symbol for "less than" bisected by a vertical line, "not."
The notation a b means that a is less than or equal to b (or, equivalently, not greater than b, or at most b); "not greater than" can also be represented by the symbol for "greater than" bisected by a vertical line, "not."
The notation a b means that a is not equal to b, but does not say that one is greater than the other or even that they can be compared in size.
The ohm (symbol: is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.
The product operator in mathematics, indicated with capital pi notation (in analogy to the use of the capital Sigma as summation symbol).
The ship was captured by the Italians during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, although she was only used for coastal and second-line tasks. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was captured by Germany, and, after being fitted with additional anti-aircraft guns, she served with the German Navy or the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia as TA48. In German/Croatian service her crew of 52 consisted entirely of Croatian officers and enlisted men. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in February 1945 while in the port of Trieste, where she had been built.
The symbol is encoded in Unicode at U+221E infinity (HTML: &#8734; &infin;) and in LaTeX as \infty.
The symbol used to denote partial derivatives is One of the first known uses of this symbol in mathematics is by Marquis de Condorcet from 1770, who used it for partial differences. The modern partial derivative notation is by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1786), though he later abandoned it; Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi re-introduced the symbol in 1841.
The text states: "Signum majoritatis ut a > b significet a majorem quam b" and "Signum minoritatis ut a < b significet a minorem quam b."
The widely adopted form of two equal-length strokes connecting in an acute angle at the left, <, has been found in documents dated as far back as the 1560s.
This is the partial derivative of f with respect to x. Here is a rounded d called the partial derivative symbol. To distinguish it from the letter d, is sometimes pronounced "tho" or "partial".
Various online web sites provide to many more digits. While the decimal representation of has been computed to more than a trillion digits, elementary applications, such as estimating the circumference of a circle, will rarely require more than a dozen decimal places. For example, the decimal representation of truncated to 11 decimal places is good enough to estimate the circumference of any circle that fits inside the Earth with an error of less than one millimetre, and the decimal representation of truncated to 39 decimal places is sufficient to estimate the circumference of any circle that fits in the observable universe with precision comparable to the radius of a hydrogen atom.
We obtained electroluminescence (EL) at a low current density of up to around room temperature.
When threatened or harmed, they will "play possum", mimicking the appearance and smell of a sick or dead animal. This physiological response is involuntary (like fainting), rather than a conscious act. In the case of baby opossums, however, the brain does not always react this way at the appropriate moment, and therefore they often fail to "play dead" when threatened. When an opossum is "playing possum", the animal's lips are drawn back, the teeth are bared, saliva foams around the mouth, the eyes close or half-close, and a foul-smelling fluid is secreted from the anal glands. The stiff, curled form can be prodded, turned over, and even carried away without reaction. The animal will typically regain consciousness after a period of a few minutes to four hours, a process that begins with slight twitching of the ears.
When toning down expletives, asterisks are often used to replace letters. For example, the word 'fuck' might become 'f**k', 'f*ck' or even '****'. Vowels tend to be censored with an asterisk more than consonants, but the intelligibility of censored profanities with multiple syllables such as b*ll*cks (bollocks) or uncommon ones is higher if put in context with surrounding text.
[Almost Equal To] is a funny and brutal play that tries (and fails?) to give the audience a maximized entertainment value for every dollar invested. Premiered October 23, 2014 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, was performed until spring 2016.
